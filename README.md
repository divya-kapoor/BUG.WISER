1.3) Conventions Used in This Manual

To make this user guide as clear and easy to follow as possible, we have established a set of conventions that will be used throughout the manual. These conventions are designed to clarify when we are illustrating user input, system output, and other elements of interaction with the BugWiser Tracking System.
Any text displayed by the program will be in bolded Courier font.
The terminal window will be represented by a square box.
Keys on a keyboard will be represented by greater than and less than symbols, e.g., <key>
Prompts will be represented within square brackets, e.g., [Prompt].
Error messages will also be displayed in bolded Courier font e.g., "ERROR: Invalid selection".
Any text entered by the user will be in non-bolded Courier font.
Users must confirm actions by typing specific numbers or letters and pressing enter.
To select options from a menu, the user must type the corresponding number next to the menu option and press enter.
P: Displays the previous 20 items in a list. If there are no previous items, the message "NO PREVIOUS LIST ITEMS AVAILABLE" will be shown.

Please note that these conventions are used consistently throughout the manual to guide your understanding and use of the BugWiser Tracking System. Following these conventions will help ensure a smooth and effective interaction with our system.








2.0) Installation

2.1) System Requirements
To use BigWiser, you will need:
A minimum of 4 GB RAM
At least 2 GB of free disk space
A processor with 1 GHz or faster
A monitor
A keyboard and mouse or equivalent input device (mouse to navigate through Windows)
An internet connection with a speed of at least 1 Mbps
Windows 10 or later
Note that BugWiser does not require any specific operating system to run, we recommend using a recent version of your operating system with all the latest updates installed for the best user experience.
2.2) Back-Up of Distribution Disks                    
We strongly recommend that you back up the BugWiser system to a secure storage device before installation. This ensures that you have a copy of the program in case the original becomes damaged or lost. Here is a typical back-up procedure:
Insert the BugWiser system disk into your computer's disk drive.
Access your system's command line interface. You can do this by: a) Starting it up, if it's not already running. b) If you're on a Windows system, start the command line interface in a new window.
Type c: and press Enter.
Type cd\ and press Enter.
Create a temporary directory by typing md tempBugWiser and press Enter.
Navigate to the newly created directory by typing cd tempBugWiser and press Enter.
Copy the contents of the BugWiser disk to the hard drive by typing copy a:\*.* c: and press Enter.
Remove the BugWiser disk from the drive and insert a blank, formatted storage device.
To create a back-up copy, type copy *.* a: and press Enter.
Remove the back-up storage device from the drive.
Delete the temporary storage by typing del *.* and pressing Enter.
Navigate back to the root directory by typing cd\ and pressing Enter.
Finally, remove the temporary directory by typing rd tempBugWiser and pressing Enter.
Remember to keep the back-up copy in a safe and secure location.

2.3) Installation Steps: 
		
BugWiser will be available on Universal Serial Buses (USBs). To install the system, follow the steps below: 
Connect the USB to the USB-C port to view the contents of the flash drive on the computer.
Navigate to the folder that contains the USB‚Äôs content, usually found under the ‚ÄúThis PC‚Äù section. Look for an image of a flash drive labelled ‚ÄúBugWiser‚Äù.
Double-click on the drive to open it. You will see a folder named ‚ÄúBugWiser system‚Äù. This folder is important because it contains the application.
It is recommended to copy the ‚ÄúBugWiser system‚Äù folder and paste it in an easily accessible and memorable location. A good option is the Desktop, as it will be visible whenever the computer is turned on.
Double-click on the folder to open it, and you should see a file named BugWiser.exe. Right-click on this file and select "Run as administrator".
If a warning screen appears asking, "Do you want this app to make changes to your device?", click "Yes". This prompt is a standard security measure and is nothing to be concerned about.
	Remember to keep the back-up copy in a safe place. 

2.4) How to Start the BugWiser System

	To begin running the program, open a console window via "Command Prompt" and then press <enter>, and navigate to the directory in which you saved the folder via <cd> commands. Once in the appropriate folder enter "BugWiser.exe" to begin the program.

	




3.0)	Introductions to the User Interface

	The User Interface system in the BugWiser Tracking System will be a scrolling terminal with a text-only interface. Because this is a scrolling terminal, the screen will not be cleared. Each new text that is displayed will cause the previous text to scroll up. The actual text that is displayed in the User Interface cannot be moved, resized, or deleted (unless the source of the text is from the user‚Äôs keyboard). The text displayed by the program cannot be selected, but please note that we will be using the word ‚Äúselect‚Äù throughout this user manual (see section 3.2 for an explanation of the usage of ‚Äúselect‚Äù).


	3.1) Menu System
	To utilize the menu, the user must access it via the keyboard. The user can choose the menu option they would like to select by typing the corresponding digit next to the option followed by the <enter> key. Each option will either direct the user to a sub-menu, or prompt the user to input information. When selecting from a long list of items, the user may opt to select the menu option ‚ÄúDisplay More‚Äù. This will trigger the program to display more of the items that the user is currently viewing. Please refer to section  6.3 for the full Menu tree. The following error message will appear if the user enters a number that is not on the list:
ERROR: Invalid selection. The option you entered does not exist.


	The Main Menu will be the first menu as well as the first text that will be displayed when the program starts.

======Main Menu======
1) Create New
2) Modify Existing
3) Assess
4) Query
5) Print Report
0) Quit
Type your selection and press ENTER:



	3.2)	Data Entry
	When asked to ‚Äúselect‚Äù an item, the user must type the number next to the menu option they would like to choose and then press <enter> on their keyboard. For example, when the user is on the Main Menu (as shown above), if the user wants to select the ‚ÄúPrint Report‚Äù option. The user must type ‚Äú4‚Äù and then press <enter>.

	In general, all inputs to the system by the user must be followed by the <enter> key for the system to register the input.

		Data entry can only be done using a keyboard. When the user is given a prompt 		by the system, the user can immediately begin typing their input‚Äîit is not necessary for 		the user to click on anything in the user interface.


	3.3)	Prompts
		There are different types of prompts that the program may output. A prompt will 		be represented by square brackets, i.e. [prompt].

1)  Selecting from a list

------Sub Menu Name-----
== Please type 0 to go back to the Main Menu ==
== P for the previous 20 items ==
== N for the next 20 items ==
== B to go back to the previous selection == 

[Prompt]
1) [Option A]
2) [Option B]
..
..
20) [Option X]


	The user will then type in the number adjacent to their desired choice, and press <enter>. On all menus (other than the conformation question menu) the option of "0" will be available to return to the Main Menu.

== Please type 0 to go back to the Main Menu ==
== P for the previous 20 items ==
== N for the next 20 items ==
== B to go back to the previous selection == 

	
	If the user enters "P" and presses <enter>, the previous 20 items in the list will be displayed. However, if these are the first 20 items of the list, a systematic error will be shown with the message: 

NO PREVIOUS LIST ITEMS AVAILABLE


	If the user enters "N", the next 20 items in the list will be displayed. Similarly, if there are no more items, the following error will be shown:

NO MORE LIST ITEMS AVAILABLE


 	As with previous lists and sections, if the user selects "0", the system will automatically return them to the Main Menu.


            2)  Confirmation Question

Is the following information correct:
New data will be here

1) Confirm
0) Cancel
Type your selection and press ENTER:


		After the user enters new data (i.e. new product, new product release, new data, 		new requester, new issue description), the system will ask for confirmation to continue. If 	the user enters ‚Äú1‚Äù , the system will submit the answer, and move on to the next menu 		item. Otherwise, if the user types ‚Äú0‚Äù, the system will ignore the new data, and send the 		user back to the Main Menu. 

Note:  If the user enters an input they would like to change while creating an object, the user must continue entering the prompts and can only cancel the operation once the program continues onto the confirmation question.  


3)  Entering Data Items
	If there is data that must be manually entered then the program will prompt the user accordingly, and provide an example of the expected format.

Please enter phone number
(10-11 digits, E.g. 11234567890)


	The user is then to type in the correct information followed by pressing <enter>. Entering data in an incorrect format may result in the malfunctioning of the system. It is the users responsibility to assure the proper format of information entered as the system may or may not prevent incorrect inputs.

3.4)	Modifying Attributes
	The option of ‚ÄúModify Existing‚Äù is available for Change Items that are currently in the ‚ÄúAssessed‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn-Progress‚Äù state. Change Items in the ‚ÄúFresh‚Äù, ‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDone‚Äù state can not be modified. Once a Change Item is selected the user can modify the description, status, priority, or its anticipated fix release ID. 

	The best way to modify the data, is by navigating to option 2 in the Main Menu, where the system will redirect the user to the following sub menu:

------Modify Existing:-----
1) Change Item
B) Previous Menu
Type your selection and press ENTER:

		In this case, the user has two options: type ‚Äú1‚Äù to access the fields available for 		editing, or type ‚Äú0‚Äù to return to the Main Menu. Note for a new change item, the system 		will automatically generate a new unique change ID that can not be edited. 















4.0) Operating Procedures.

	Enter an input means that the user types in the input and then pressed <enter>. e.g. Enter the menu option 2.

	This section assumes the user knows how to operate the system‚Äôs menus and accurately input the data; please refer to section 3 and its following subsections for further detail on the operation of menus.
4.0.1)	Organization of Section 4
	Each subsection of section 4 (i.e. 4.1, 4.2, etc..) will explain the different operating procedures for each option in the Main Menu. The subsections for each section (i.e. 4.1.1, 4.1.2, etc‚Ä¶) will be the other operating procedures related to the Main Menu option chosen. 

	Each operating procedure will be a step by step explanation of different procedures a user can operate. The steps for each procedure will be enumerated‚Äîi.e. 1), 2), 3). Any subsections of a step (i, ii, iii, iv) indicate different paths a user can select when on a specific step.

Important Symbols:
‚òû indicates steps where the user must enter an option displayed in the menu. If the user enters a non existing menu option, an error message will occur (refer to section 6.1.1).

‚ö†Ô∏é indicates steps where the user input could trigger an error message (refer to section 6.1). The description of the error will be listed in greater detail at the bottom of the operating procedure.
4.0.2)	Formatting of the Operating Procedures
	Courier font (i.e. Courier), inside of a box will represent any text that is displayed on the screen. There will be two types of text:

-Any text that is displayed and outputted by the program will be represented by 	bolded Courier font. E.g:

Bolded represents what the system will output.




-Any text that is inputted by the user and then displayed onto the screen will be represented by non bolded Courier font. E.g:

Non bolded represents what a user may input.


	Italicized Times New Roman font surrounded by two asterisks will represent 	notes/comments for the reader of this User Manual; these notes are for further context.

** Enter note for the reader ** 

Note: The system does not display these notes.

	There will be some text shown in the User Manual that will not be displayed in the program verbatim. Square brackets will be used to indicate places in which text is displayed but may vary throughout the program.The content inside the square brackets are notes as to what will be displayed. There may also be examples of what a user has input.

[prompt]
[user‚Äôs option]

Note: The system does not display the above text verbatim, ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù is a placeholder 		for information already inputted and stored in the system.

Important: Each operating procedure will have the following format: 

1) The instructions for the operating procedure will be typed above the box that represents the system display.

0) Quit
Type your selection and press ENTER: 1 
** the input above will show what the user should enter** 

	
	 * The format for the Bugwiser's procedures was selected by Pixel Pioneers' 	software team because it is simple to use and flows well, reducing confusion and 		ultimately improving the user experience.

Notes on the examples for sample data:
	The sample data displayed in the screenshots of the operating procedures will appear in a specific format to represent the data that will be displayed. 
Sample data using characters {A..Z, a..z, 0..9} will be displayed as underlined ‚Äúx‚Äùs:
This includes spaces, periods and other characters that can be inputted by a keyboard.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
